# NeuralSpeech

**NeuralSpeech** is a research project in Microsoft Research Asia focusing on neural network based speech processing, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), text to speech (TTS), etc. 

Currently this repo covers several research work: 
* Automatic Speech Recognition
  + [FastCorrect, NeurIPS 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03842.pdf) 
  + [FastCorrect 2, EMNLP 2021 Findings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14420.pdf)
  + [CMatch, INTERSPEECH 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07491.pdf)
  + [Adapter, TASLP 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11905.pdf)
* Text to Speech
  + [LightSpeech, ICASSP 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04040.pdf)
  + [PriorGrad, ICLR 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06406.pdf)
